# keywordExtraction
API for extracting keywords from text using RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction algorithm) and posTaging

This project uses an implementation of RAKE (As described in the paper `Automatic keyword extraction from individual
documents` by Stuart Rose, Dave Engel, Nick Cramer and Wendy Cowley.) and spacey posTaging library to generate keyword summaries of from any given text. It currently only supports english language.
